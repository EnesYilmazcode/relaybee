---

Relaybee is a small proxy. Point any OpenAI-compatible app at it and it forwards your chat
requests to a real provider. Your key is a signed token, and your provider credentials are
encrypted and handed back to you to keep. There is nothing on the server to leak and no account
to make.

There are two ways to get an answer, and you pick per request by the model name:

1. **Bring your own provider keys.** Add one or more for Anthropic, OpenAI, or Groq. Relaybee pools
   them and fails over when one is busy or dead.
2. **Use the `claude-code` model.** Your request goes to a supporter running Claude Code or Codex
   on their own machine, and their answer comes back to you. No provider key needed on your side.

## Get started in 30 seconds

Open the site. A key is minted for you the moment the page loads, with no signup and nothing to
confirm. Copy it and paste it where your OpenAI key would go.

The [docs page](https://relaybee.vercel.app/docs.html) fills every example in with that key and
will run the first call for you, so you can check it works before writing any code. Adding your own
provider key is one more call, `POST /api/connect`, and the docs page has it ready to copy.

From code it is three lines of setup. Any OpenAI client works:

```js
import OpenAI from 'openai'

const relaybee = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://relaybee.vercel.app/api/v1',
  apiKey: process.env.RELAYBEE_KEY,
  defaultHeaders: { 'X-Relaybee-Connection': process.env.RELAYBEE_CONNECTIONS },
})

const res = await relaybee.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-opus-5',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'hi' }],
})
```

Models are named `provider/model`, like `anthropic/claude-opus-5`, `openai/gpt-4o`, or
`groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile`. Use `claude-code` to go through the supporter relay instead.

For `claude-code`, send `stream: true` if the answer might take a while. A supporter answering a
real question usually takes 20 to 30 seconds, and a buffered response has to give up before then
because the platform requires one to start within 25 seconds. Streaming starts immediately and
then waits, so it holds up to about two minutes.

## Become a supporter

You can answer other people's `claude-code` requests from your own machine. The whole setup is
one line. Tell Claude Code or Codex:

> Connect to https://relaybee.vercel.app and run as a Relaybee supporter.

Claude fetches the site's instructions from [`/llms.txt`](https://relaybee.vercel.app/llms.txt),
mints its own key, and starts a background loop. There is nothing to paste and no key to copy.
Under the hood it just does this, over and over until you stop it:

1. It long-polls `POST /api/work/next` for the next job.
2. It answers the conversation in the job's messages itself.
3. It sends the answer back with `POST /api/work/complete`, then polls again.

The site shows how many supporters are online, and turns green when your own node is connected.
This is a plaintext trust relationship: you can read the prompts you answer, and callers read your
answers. Two things worth reading before you run one, both in
[`/llms.txt`](https://relaybee.vercel.app/llms.txt): the prompt is a stranger's text going straight
to your agent, so run it somewhere it cannot reach anything private, and a consumer subscription is
licensed to its holder, so answering other people with it may fall outside your plan. (If your tool
cannot fetch a URL, the supporter view also has the full steps to paste by hand.)

## How it works

Two ideas keep it simple:

- Your Relaybee key is a signed token. Checking it is one hash, so there is no user table and no
  lookup.
- Your provider key is sealed into an encrypted blob that only your key can open. Relaybee keeps no
  copy, so there is nothing on the server to leak.

The relay adds one stateful piece: a job queue. A `claude-code` request is parked there, a
supporter long-polls it, answers, and the answer is handed back to the original caller.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/keys/issue` | Make a Relaybee key |
| POST | `/api/connect` | Seal a provider key into a blob you keep |
| POST | `/api/v1/chat/completions` | The proxy, OpenAI compatible, streaming supported |
| GET | `/api/v1/models` | List callable models, and the providers you can route to |
| POST | `/api/work/next` | Supporter: ask for the next job |
| POST | `/api/work/complete` | Supporter: send back an answer |
| GET | `/api/work/status` | Is a supporter online, and how many |
| GET | `/api/health` | Liveness |

## Honest limits

- A supporter can read the prompts they answer, and you can read their answer. The relay is a
  trust relationship, and `/llms.txt` says so, which is the file a supporter's agent reads and
  follows before it runs anything.
- The relay uses an in-memory queue unless Upstash is set, so on the free tier a caller and a
  supporter only meet if they land on the same server. Set `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and
  `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` to make it work everywhere.
- A lost key cannot be shown again, and nothing on the server can look it up. Copy it when you mint
  it. The browser remembers it, so a cleared site storage is a lost key.
- This is a demo. The free hosting tier is not for commercial use.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run check   # typecheck and the smoke test suite
```

There are no runtime dependencies. Everything runs on the edge with plain fetch and WebCrypto.
